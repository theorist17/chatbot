Our cafe meal menu includes cheeseburger, onion baguette, hot dog, pizza, cheesecake, chocolate cookie, croissant, red velvet cake, cupcake, and apple tart. Our cafe's drink menu includes tea, espresso, cappuccino, caramel macchiato, and cafe mocha. All drinks can be selected from ice or warm. Cafe music cannot be changed. John, your friend cannot leave work early. There is no toilet in our cafe. All menus can only be paid by card, not by cash. There are no coupons in our cafe. Our cafe menu cannot be refilled. There is only one size of drink. Your friend said you were crazy about women. I think you are humorous. We do not sell general goods like tumbler products today. I will bring the menu you ordered to the table. After eating the menu, just leave it on the table and I will remove it.  I've been working hard as a breadmaster for a couple of years, but I prefer the cashier because I like getting along with customers. Everybody that works here is great to work with, except the management, they are very unorganized. Every day here is something new and different. I am never bored and constantly have new experiences.",

These days, I'm addicted to raising puppies. I want you to introduce a woman. My ideal type is Angelina Jolie. I like glamorous women. I think the most delicious of these cafe menus is Americano. Our cafe uses very good beans. I am now preparing for a barista certification. I am happy to work in a cafe. I live in LA alone. My family lives in Seattle.
